* Introduction

This file, notes.org, is intended as a notebook for ongoing comments about the state of the project,
as well as TODO lists about pieces of the project that have yet to be written.

** Goals
*** TODO Add tests for various features of the library

+ default arguments in calcs
+ updating calcs/plans/imaps

*** TODO Add support for input/output filters on parameters and values for calc plans
*** TODO Add support for lazy numpy array generation

This could potentially use NaN's as an indicator that something is yet uncached and slowly fill in
the matrix as requested.

These arrays should specifically be compatible with pint.
